## Trying to create a thing that compares playlists of multiple people and creates a shared playlist of intersecting songs (that everyone enjoys!)

## To Do

* read Spotipy docs
* code a website interface
  - Login into Spotify button
  - Select playlist 1
  - Select playlist 2
  - Output playlist
* figure out API wiring/backend
