## Trying to create a thing that compares playlists of multiple people and creates a shared playlist of intersecting songs (that everyone enjoys!)

## To Do

* Read Spotipy docs
  - Understand Local Host connects probs, authoriztion/Bad Request

* Figure out API wiring/backend
  - How to access and use playlist data from multiple users on Spotify

* Code a website interface
  - Login into Spotify button
  - Select playlist 1
  - Select playlist 2
  - Output playlist

* Look for host (bug JHU ACM SysAdmin for JHU ACM server use?)
